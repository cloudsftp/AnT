GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

This file is part of the AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package.

AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ is an analysis tool for simulating and
investigating dynamical systems, designed, implemented and maintained
by the Nonlinear Dynamics group of the Institute of Parallel and
Distributed Systems (IPVS) at the University of Stuttgart.

Currently, the AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package consists
of two main parts: AnT and AnT-gui.

AnT is the computation engine of the AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@
software package, whereas AnT-gui is the GTK+ (see http://www.gtk.org)
based graphical user interface to the AnT computation engine.

With the AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package, one can
investigate several classes of dynamical systems such as ordinary and
recurrent maps, ordinary, delayed and functional differential
equations, coupled maps, coupled ordinary and delayed differential
equations lattices and partial differential equations as well as
stochastic and hybrid systems.

Many investigation methods such as general trajectory evaluations,
preparation of cobweb diagrams (graphical iteration), period and
region analysis, spectral analysis, principal component decomposition,
symbolic sequence analysis, symbolic image based analysis, box
counting based analysis, calculation of the Lyapunov exponents and
generalized Poincaré sections and a conditions checker are available.

Further important features are:

- The new equation parser, which makes the implementation of the
  equations of motion corresponding to the considered dynamical system
  in form of a C++ program obsolete. Currently the parser is available
  only for maps and ODEs.

- The OpenGL based visualization module

- The client/server operation mode which allows the distribution of
  time consuming computations among several nodes.

QUICK INSTALLATION
==================


Installation as root:
---------------------

        ./configure (default installation path is /usr/local)
        or
        ./configure --prefix=installation_path

        make install


Installation as user:
---------------------

        ./configure --prefix=installation_path
        make install


Running the configure script as mentioned above, the AnT
@ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package will be configured with all
features supported by the AnT engine and which are available on your
system. However, you can control specifically the configuration of
some features using the following command line switches:

        --enable-visualization=[yes|no]         default is yes
        --enable-gui=[yes|no]                   default is yes

        --with-fftw=[yes|no]                    default is yes
        --with-lapack=[yes|no]                  default is yes

For more information about the command line switches just type

        ./configure --help


After the successful installation it is required, that the following
path

        installation_path/bin

(installation_path as given above) is included in your PATH
environment variable.

To prove whether the AnT computation engine is running correctly on
your system please type

        AnT --help or AnT -h or AnT -H

You should see the following message:


--//------------/-------------------------------
 // AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@  / Release 4a, (c) @ANT_YEARS@
//------------/---------------------------------

usage: AnT <systemname> [{-i | -I | --initialization} <configfile>] [{-m | -M | --mode} <runmode>] [{-s | -S | --server} <server name>] [{-p | -P | --port} <portnumber>] [{-n | -N | --points} <scanpoints>] [{-t | -T | --time} <seconds>] [{-v | -V | --version}] [{-v | -V | --log}] [{-h | -H | --help}]

<systemname>
    complete path and filename (without extention)
    of the shared library containing at least the system
    function for the dynamical system to be simulated.

Options:
{-i | -I | --initialization} <initialization file>
    complete path and filename of the initialization file
{-m | -M | --mode} <runmode>
    where runmode is one of 'standalone',
    'server' or 'client'. Default is 'standalone'.
{-s | -S | --server} <server name>
    for runmodes 'server' and 'client' only.
    Default is the standard hostname of the current system.
{-p | -P | --port} <portnumber>
    for runmodes 'server' and 'client' only.
    The default port is 12345.
{-n | -N | --points} <scanpoints>
    for runmode 'client' only.
    The number of scanpoints the client
    should fetch from the server. Default is 50.
{-t | -T | --time} <seconds>
    for runmode 'client' only. The (approximate) number
    of seconds the client should be busy before asking
    for new scan points from the server.
    This option overrides the '-n' option.
{-v | -V | --version}
{-l | -L | --log} write the log-file 'transitions.log'
    which shows the internal structure of the current
    simulator instantiation.
{-h | -H | --help}


To prove whether the graphical user interface AnT-gui is running
correctly on your system please type

        AnT-gui [system.ant]

You should see the AnT-gui main window coming up. The initialization
file 'system.ant' is optional, so you can start from scratch if you do
not have such a file already.

In order to work with the AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software
package, it is strongly recommended, that you install also the
AnT-demos package on your system. In this package, some well-known
dynamical systems are collected. Each dynamical system is located in a
separate directory containing the C++ source file and a Makefile for
building the corresponding shared object (needed by AnT or AnT-gui).
Furthermore in each demo subdirectory there is a further Makefile
which runs the AnT computation engine and gnuplot successively to
demonstrate the demos.


Using third party libraries and/or programs with non standard locations:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you intend to employ third party software which can be used by the
AnT computation engine - for instance the fftw package for fast
fourier transforms (see http://www.fftw.org) or the clapack package
for linear algebra support (see http://www.netlib.org/clapack) - you
have to give the configure script additional information about the
location of these libraries and corresponding header files, if they
are not installed in standard directories where the configure script
automatically searches for libraries and headers. This can be done by
setting the environment variables INCLUDES and LDFLAGS to the install
path of the headers and libraries before configuring the AnT
@ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package on your machine:


        export INCLUDES="-Ipath1/include -Ipath2/include" (bash)
        setenv INCLUDES "-Ipath1/include -Ipath2/include" (csh, tcsh)

        export LDFLAGS="-Lpath1/lib -Lpath2/lib" (bash)
        setenv LDFLAGS "-Lpath1/lib -Lpath2/lib" (csh, tcsh)

Alternatively you can give the configure script two extra command line
arguments:

        INCLUDES="-Ipath1/include -Ipath2/include" LDFLAGS="-Lpath1/lib -Lpath2/lib"

Hereby, path1 and path2 and so on point to the installation prefix
directory where the third party libraries are installed in.

For more information about the command line switches just type

        ./configure --help

Furthermore, you have to update the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it contains the paths to the external
libraries.

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:path1:path2 (bash)
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:path1:path2 (csh, tcsh)


INSTALLATION for Windows (98, NT, 2000, XP) platforms
============

Start the AnT_Setup.exe installation wizard and follow the
instructions. This will install the AnT engine, the graphical user
interface AnT-gui together with all required libraries and third party
software (fftw) apart from the GTK+ Runtime Environment.

Please notice: The GTK+ Runtime Environment is required when using the
AnT @ANT_MAJOR@.@ANT_MINOR@ software package under Windows. It is possible to install
the software only when GTK+ is available on your system.
The GTK+ Runtime Environment is currently downloadable under

        http://www.dropline.net/gtk

To run the examples of the AnT-demos package a data visualization tool
is necessary. Therefore, the GNUplot utility will be installed also on
your system. To run the examples see the corresponding README.txt in the
subdirectory demos.
