2009-01-27 Andreas W., Viktor, Michael<mail@ant4669.de>
        * The new version of the graphical user interface AnT-gui
          is now available

2006-05-22 Robert, Georg, Michael, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
        * Installation as non-admin on Windows 2000 is possible now
          without error message
        * On Windows platforms: individual or system-wide installation
          is now possible
        * AnT-demo/system directory now accessibla via mouse-click from
          the startmenue
        * READMEs in AnT-demo/systems added
        * Improvement of the scripts: build-AnT-system.sh and
          [g]make-AnT-system.sh
        * Bug in EquationParser fixed

2005-11-30 Viktor, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
        * Writer for the fourier coefficients improved.

2005-11-23 Viktor, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Bug in FourierCalculator.cpp fixed.
        The Fourier coefficients were not correctly calculated.

2005-11-21 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* ConditionChecker.?pp User-defined conditions added.
	
2005-05-12 Viktor, Robert, Elmar, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
        * An equation parser for maps and ODEs is now implemented.
        Using this parser the AnT software package is able to
        investigate systems without a shared object file generated
        from the corresponding C++-source code file.
        Consequently, users without any programming experience
        can now use the capabilities of the AnT software too.
        * For CMLs a new investigation method is implemented.
        This method calculates simple statistics based on the state of
        a spatial inhomogeneous system.
        * Improved windows support.
        * Improved AnT-gui.
        * Improved standard Makefile for compilation of user systems.

2005-01-31 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
        * PeriodCalculator.cpp: check for divergent orbits added.
	Probably the implemented solution is not the most general one,
	because similar checks should be added for other investigation
	methods. However, the case Inf, Inf, ... will be never more
	detected as a fixed point ;-) 

	* RegionsCalculator.cpp: adapted, so that the regions with
	divergent and with aperodical behavior are distinguished.
	
2004-12-02 Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
        * DDE_Integratos.cpp: Gill's integration method implemented for DDEs.

2004-11-12 Robert, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
	* gtk-gui: Bugs concerning the 'new' and 'quit' button fixed;
	'Quit'-Button functionality improved.
	* configure.ac: 'AC_FUNC_MALLOC'-check removed, due to problems 
	on some systems with malloc.h.

2004-09-27 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* SymbolicEvaluator.cpp: Feature for the saving of periodic
	sequences added: After the periodic sequence is saved, the period
	is saved as well.

2004-09-23 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* SymbolicEvaluator.cpp: LR dynamic was not connected and could
	not be used. Fixed and +/- tested. Seems to be usable.

2004-09-14 Michael, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
        * The Release_3.1.9 : is downloadable now.
	
2004-09-01 Robert, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
	* MethodsPlugin.hpp, MethodsPlugin.cpp: Interface for user defined
	methods implemented. Example available in source tree under:
	'.../share' * IOStreamFactory.hpp, IOStreamFactory.cpp,
	SemanticCheck.cpp: Timestamp for all generated files implemented
	(in configuration files also).

2004-08-13 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* bug fixed in Period calculator: max period value was 
	used not correct ('time < maxPeriod' instead of '<=')

2004-07-28 Robert, Viktor, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Poincare sections were broken... fixed!
        * The Release_3.1.8 : is downloadable now.

2004-07-13 Michael, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
        * The Release_3.1.7 : is downloadable now.

2004-07-13 Robert, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
        * OpenGL visualization: hard exit problem
          under Windows fixed
        * initial value functions (sawtooth, etc.) for temporal
          systems with delay corrected

2004-06-17 Robert, Michael, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
        * The Release_3.1.6 : is downloadable now.

2004-06-08 Robert <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Bug fixed: Some cellular initial state resetters (singular,
	  periodic step, ...) were incorrect (wrong indexing). Another bug
	  concerning the 'roundTo'-template and leading to wrong rounded 
	  values was eliminated also...

2004-05-24 Robert, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
	* The Release_3.1.5 : is free.

2004-05-21 Robert <mail@ant4669.de>
	* missing: 'RandomVariableResetter' class added for temporal
	initial functions support...

2004-05-18 Robert, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Bug fixed: Lyapunov exponents were calculated wrong
	for FDEs. Added 'adjacentOrbitsIterator(i)->reset()' after
	each Gram-Schmidt application. It was necessary, because
	the iterators for FDEs do save some intermediate states internally.

	* Bug fixed: RKF456 for FDEs was buggy. Corrected.

2004-05-18 Robert <mail@ant4669.de>
	* notice: MinGW implementation now without segfault (XP misery
	concerning file closing and global destructors noticed and avoided) 

2004-05-17 Robert, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
	* lyapunov analysis: now we have one iterator/integrator for
	each adjacent orbit (bug fixed)

2004-05-17 Robert, Michael <mail@ant4669.de>
	* some files:
	gcc-3.4.0 compatibility reached and some bugs
        ('DDE_Integrator', etc.) fixed.
        HUGE_VAL replaced by DBL_MAX in 'symimages'.

2004-05-04 Robert, Georg <mail@ant4669.de>
	* some files:
	Extra 'getopt' library removed. The functionality moved to
	AnT-init.cpp.
	Support for MinGW (and even sockets!) included.

2004-04-29 Robert, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* InitialStates.cpp, InitialStates.hpp: (Bug fixed)
	Random initialization for spatial inhomogeneous system types
	corrected (forgotten 'initialize ()' call added).

2004-04-28 Robert, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* InitialStates.cpp, InitialStates.hpp
	* NoiseGenerator.cpp, SemanticCheck.cpp,
	* SemanticCheck.hpp, GlobalKeys.cfg
	Random initialization for spatial inhomogeneous  
	system types was not really implemented. Redesigned and fixed.
	
2004-04-28 Robert, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* DynSysData.cpp, InitialStates.cpp: (Bug fixed)
	Output of initial states for spatial inhomogeneous  
	system types was buggy. Fixed.

2004-04-27 Robert, Viktor <mail@ant4669.de>
	* CML_Proxy.cpp, CML_Proxy.hpp:
	A non-standard (advanced) interface for CMLs added:
	User has to set in the system function 
	not only a single cell, but the whole cellular state.

2004-04-27 Viktor <mail@ant4669.de> 
	New saving policy for CMLs: User can set it to cell or state
	oriented. Still to do: the same for PDEs and CODELs

2004-04-20 NLD Group   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* The Release_3.1.4 : is free.
	
2004-04-19 Robert: <mail@ant4669.de>
	* GuiController.cpp, Configuration.cpp: (Bug fixed)

2004-04-15 Robert, Michael   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* NoiseGenerator.cpp, NoiseGenerator.hpp: (Bug fixed)
	Thanks to Uwe Husmann who detected first, that the NoiseGenerators
	didn't use the seed values correctly.

2004-04-08 Viktor, Michael: <mail@ant4669.de>
	* GlobalKeys.cfg, NoiseGenerator.cpp: (Bug fixed) 
	Thanks to Uwe Husmann who detected first, that noisy variables
	couldn't be used.

2004-04-07 Viktor, Michael: <mail@ant4669.de>
	* HybridODE_Integratore.cpp, HybridODE_Integrator.hpp: (Bug fixed)
	Calculation of the velocity for hybrid ODEs corrected.
	Note: This Bug for other types of hybrid systems is currently not fixed.

2004-04-06 Michael: <mail@ant4669.de>
	* ODE_Integrator.cpp, ODE_Integrator.hpp: Gill44 integration
	method implemented for ODEs as stepper and Butcher array

2004-03-30 NLD Group   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* The Release_3.1.2 : is free.

2004-04-07 Viktor, Michael: (Bug 'fixed'): Calculation
	of the velocity for hybrid ODEs corrected. Note:
	The similar problem for other types of hybrid systems remains
	still.

2004-04-06 Michael: Gill44 integration method implemented (as a stepper
	and as a Butcher array)

2004-04-06 Georg, Robert   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* AnT-gui.cpp: path length increased.
	Windows: A popup window occurs, when AnT-gui is finished.

2004-03-30 NLD Group   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* The Release_3a : is public.

2004-03-28 Georg, Robert   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* (a lot of files): Support for cygwin completed.

2004-02-12 Georg Wackenhut   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* configure.as: Support for build of dll's included.

2003-06-13 Viktor, Claudia   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Orbit.hpp, DynSysData.*, TrajectorySaver.* and VelocityCalculator.cpp:
	The output files initial_states.gra and orbit.gra can be 
	plotted for all systems in system type specific formats.
	The corresponding output routines moved to the data--objects,
	therefore the Write(Current/Initial)State(s) routines are
	simplified.

2003-05-16 Viktor, Claudia   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* AnT.cpp: default setting for the configuration file: if it is
	not given using the -i option, then it will be assumed that the
	ini-file has the same name as the shared object containing the
	system function and it is located in the current directory from
	where AnT is called.

2003-05-15 Viktor, Claudia   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* ranges in dimensions analysis are changed: former: 2 dim array: 
	1st component contained all minimas, 2nd component all maximas,
	now: n dimensional array (n is stateSpaceDim). Array contains now 
	pairs of values which are (min, max) for each state variable.

2003-03-15 AnT group   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* The Release_2a : is free.

2003-03-14  AnT group   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* (a lot of files): Some bugs fixed. New system types supported:
	one-dimensional PDEs and FDEs. Integrators for FDEs implemented.
	Network support changed: external library libsocket++ is omitted. 

2002-12-18  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addObjectsPanel): Fixed empty
	AlphaBorder when there are no planes.

2002-12-4 Viktor    <mail@ant4669.de>
        * Poincare redesign: - completed. New type of sections - MinMaxPoints.

2002-12-4 Viktor    <mail@ant4669.de>
	* Poincare redesing: a lot of functions are moved to the
	corresponding proxy, so that the inside simulator is now
	protected. Due to the virtual reset routine in this proxy 
	the Poincare initializer and resetter are now much more simpler

2002-12-4 Robert, Viktor   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* (a lot of files): deprecated header <strstream> replaced with
	the standard header <sstream>. However, the g++ compiler with the
	version number less 3.0 does not support this new header.  Here we
	include the old header
	(see src/engine/utils/GlobalConstants.hpp)

2002-12-3  Viktor   <mail@ant4669.de>
	* dd (a lot of files): Initial values calculation for Poincare
	maps reviewd and corrected. For the parameter-dependent plane
	the class planeResetter is removed and the reset will be now
	performed by the more general initialized and resetters.

2002-11-20  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/helpwindow.cpp (hideWin): Introduced
	reinterpret_cast.

2002-11-02  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addObjectsPanel): alpha for
	planes is configurable in the gui.

2002-11-01  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/utils/globals/GlobalKeys.cfg (VISUALIZATION): Added key:
	PLANE_ALPHA_KEY.

2002-10-31  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addPanelAppearence): Removed
	global checkbox "objects visible".
	* src/visualization/AVGraphicPrimitive.hpp (class
	AVGraphicPrimitive): Restructuring.
	* src/visualization/parse_control.cpp (createObjectCmds): Each
	object can and should have a name which is displayed in the
	visibility control panel. Otherwise its type name and a unique id
	are used as its name.
	* src/utils/globals/GlobalKeys.cfg (VISUALIZATION): Added key:
	VISUALIZATION::WINDOW::OBJECT::VISIBILITY_KEY to control the
	visibility of each object.
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addCurveControlsToPanel): Show
	projections only in 3d control panel.
	(addObjectsPanel): A checkbox for each object to control its
	visibility.

2002-10-29  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/rendering.cpp (drawProjections): Use marker
	from original curve.

2002-10-25  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/rendering.cpp (drawProjections): Added marker
	support.
	* src/visualization/flying.cpp (computeFlyingParameter): Toggle
	button text when flight is over.
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addPanelDimensions): edittext
	-> spinner.
	* src/visualization/flying.cpp (toggleFlight): Added toggle which
	does the job of startflyingCamera and stopflyingCamera and toggles
	the name of the button. This causes a repaint in the control
	panel, doesn't look so good.
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (addFlyControlPanel): Removed
	stop button.

2002-10-20  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/filter.cpp (setFile): printf on a null pointer
	caused a segmentation fault on solaris.
	* src/visualization/controlwin.cpp (initMainGlui): Added a dummy
	window to circumvent the display bugs of the help window.
	* src/visualization/helpwindow.hpp (THelpWindow): Inherits from
	GLUI now.
	* src/visualization/helpwindow.cpp (center): Added possibility to
	center a help window.

2002-10-19  Felix Berger  <felixberger@beldesign.de>
	* src/visualization/helpwindow.cpp (addString): Alignment can be
	specified as a parameter.

	* configure.ac: Released for Autoconf 2.52.
	From

	Report from 
	* Makefile.am: Updated for using with new configuration.
